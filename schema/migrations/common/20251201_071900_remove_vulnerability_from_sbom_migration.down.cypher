/*
 * Migration Rollback: Remove Vulnerability Schema from SBOM Enhancement Migration
 * Version: 2025.12.01.071900
 * Author: Ona
 * 
 * Description:
 * Rollback for the consolidation migration. This is a no-op rollback since the
 * forward migration was also a no-op (documentation only).
 *
 * To restore vulnerability schema, you would need to:
 * 1. Rollback migration 20251125_074808_remove_vulnerability_node
 * 2. Re-apply migration 20251102_180000_enhance_component_for_sbom
 *
 * However, this is NOT recommended as it contradicts ADR-0003.
